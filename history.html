        <h2 id="earlyhistory">From Confusion to Rigor</h2>
        <p>
          The history of black holes starts in 1915, with Albert Einstein's publication of the Theory of General Relativity in the form of the Einstein Field Equations.
          Though that was during the First World War, it would only take a few months before the discovery of the first solutions.
          Karl Schwartzchild would soon publish what today is known as the Schwartzchild Metric, a set of exact solutions to the Einstein Field Equations, describing a massive, non-rotating, non-charged, and spherically-symmetric object.
          These solutions are a good approximation for standard astrophysical bodies like Earth or the Sun, since they are for most purposes spherically symmetrical, not super-charged, nor rotating extremely quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, at this early stage, two separate singularities were identified in the solution.
          These occur at what we today know as the event horizon, and at the very center of the object.
          Early on, it was hard to tell if these singularities were physical at all.
          As a result, other solutions, namely the Gullstrand-Painlev&eacute Metric, showed contradictory results -- specifically, that the singularity at the event horizon was not there at all.
          In fact, originally both authors argued that it was proof Einstein was wrong, since it appeared that there were multiple physically different results for the same system. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Time, however, was favorable to General Relativity.
          In 1933, Lema&icirctre showed that in fact the Gullstrand-Painlev&eacute solution was merely a coordinate transformation of the Schwartzchild Metric, and argued that the singularity at the event horizon was simply an artifact of the original coordinates chosen by Schwartzchild.
          By the end of 1960s, application of new mathematics to the problem allowed for the first definition of what actually occurred at the Schwartzchild Radius: a boundary in space-time coordinates, which nothing inside the object can pass.
          The singularity at the center of the black hole was also shown to appear generically.
          <br>
          The conceptual black hole had been born and made rigorous.

        <h2 id="">But Are They Real?</h2>
        <p>
          Even once the question of if they were a physically meaningful prediciton of General Relativity had been sorted in the 1960s, the question of if they were real objects remained.
          After all, though they were predicted, perhaps other processes might prevent their formation, some kind of 'cosmic censorship'.
          Since looking on Earth was almost certainly fruitless -- we would've found them by now -- instead this question was turned over to the astronomers.
          It would not be long before candidate objects were found.
          By 1973, the famous <a href="observation.html#cygx1">Cygnus X-1</a> was identified as a prime candidate, and soon other objects too were identified.
          With the confirmation of physical black holes, not only was Einstein again proven correct, but astrophysics now had a brand-new and exciting area of research, one which corresponded with new <a href="observation.html">observations</a> being made at the time.
