        <h2>What are black holes?</h2>
        <p>
          Black holes are regions of space-time caused when a massive body becomes so dense that the surface gravity of the body causes the escape velocity to exceed the speed of light. As nothing can travel faster than light, this creates a region of spacetime where things -- like matter and energy -- can enter, but nothing can leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the longest time, black holes were seen as possibly only theoretical. However, today, we have observed and studied extensively dozens of these objects, cataloguing extremely compelling <a href="evidence.html">observational evidence</a> for these object's existence.
        </p>
        <h2>How were black holes discovered?</h2>
        <p>
          Black holes were first predicted in 1915 by Karl Schwartzchild, a German physicist, using Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, published earlier that year. Schwartzchild's solution to the Einstien Field Equations created a singularity at the very center of a non-spinning, non-charged black hole. This was poorly-understood at the time, but later research showed that this object would have an event horizon. This event horizon forms the boundary between the inside and the outside of the black hole, and
